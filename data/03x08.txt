Don't turn this into yet another one of your crusades against your childhood. Just let it go.

That's why.'", "EMILY: Fine, Lorelai, your father's a demon. He's cruel and out to destroy your happiness.

Step back. Wrinkle. And sigh.", "RICHARD: I did no such thing.", "EMILY: And then he'd talk about the paintings he had seen in Paris and the colors of Titian, and by the end of the date, you thought he was the most brilliant man in the entire world.", "LORELAI: Using Titian to score.

He wouldn't let me off the hook.", "RORY: But I haven't applied to Yale.", "RICHARD: Oh, I told him that you weren't finished deciding, that you were being very picky.

You corner her alone the other night, without me there.", "RICHARD: Of course I did. You wouldn't let her go.", "LORELAI: Oh, I wouldn't?", "RICHARD: I knew that the last thing in the world that you could want would be for Rory to go to Yale.", "LORELAI: And the reason for that would be?", "RICHARD: I went to Yale, therefore Rory can't.", "LORELAI: Oh, that's right, the crazy reason.", "RICHARD: That's all right. It's your prerogative to feel that way.

Which, frankly Lorelai, is something you know nothing about.", "LORELAI: Excuse me?", "RICHARD: You never went to college, let alone an Ivy League college. You don't know the first thing about the system, the way it works. I do, I went through it. You want Rory to go to Harvard that badly? Well, so do thousands of other mothers. Yale is an excellent school, the equal of Harvard in every way except one \u0096 I went here. I'm an alumnus. That makes it easier for Rory to get in. And if you had any idea about the way the system works, you'd know this.", "LORELAI: Oh, so, here it is. I knew we would eventually get to the big \"my daughter's a loser, poor me, the future squandered, the Gilmore name's sullied\" speech.", "RICHARD: I am not going to leave Rory's education to chance simply because I might risk offending you. Her future is more important than your pride. If you don't like that, I'm sorry. If it makes you angry, well, what else is new?

Damn, I just forgot the number.", "EMILY: If you would just calm down and look at it from his point of view.", "LORELAI: [on phone] Hi, um, uh, in New Haven, I need a cab company, any cab company.", "EMILY: Your father is a very strong-willed man, Lorelai. You know this, you take after him.", "LORELAI: [on phone] Thank you.", "EMILY: He wants the best for Rory. He thinks this is the best.", "LORELAI: It doesn't really matter what he thinks. It matters what I think and what Rory thinks and the list ends there.", "EMILY: So Rory takes a meeting at Yale. That doesn't mean she still won't go to Harvard.", "LORELAI: I know it doesn't, because she is still going to Harvard.", "EMILY: If she applies to Yale \u0096", "LORELAI: She's not applying to Yale!", "EMILY: And gets into Yale, that might even make her more appealing to Harvard. Have you thought about that?", "LORELAI: No, I haven't, because I'm not trying to reason away a crazy man's actions.", "EMILY: Oh, don't do this. Don't turn this into yet another one of your crusades against your childhood. Just let it go. Realize that despite the matter in which your father did this, his intentions were honorable.", "LORELAI: You know what, Mom? Sometimes I literally sit around and try to figure out why Dad and I have such an awful relationship. I try to figure out why we can't communicate and why we can't seem to break through whatever crap it is that stands between us, and then something like this happens and suddenly it's like, \u0091Oh yeah. That's why.'", "EMILY: Fine, Lorelai, your father's a demon. He's cruel and out to destroy your happiness. But think about this \u0096 you're fighting so hard to send Rory off to Harvard no matter what that you haven't even stopped for one second to consider that if she went to Yale, she could live at home.

That's why I can't believe you didn't prepare me for it. I didn't have my transcripts, my letters of recommendation. I couldn't even remember what I wanted to major in when he asked.", "RICHARD: I'm sure he knew you were nervous.", "RORY: But I didn't have to be that nervous. I could've been calm. I could've brushed my hair. I never would've worn this.", "RICHARD: Oh, Rory, none of this matters.", "RORY: It matters to me. I like to be prepared. This has nothing to do with Mom.
