That was the concept \u0096 get back to the concept! This is not Gangs of New York now with Cameron Diaz. This is Gangs of New York twenty years ago with Meryl Streep as Scorsese originally imagined it. Come back, refocus, remember the goal. Am I making myself clear?", "JOE: Cameron Diaz is hot.", "RORY: Not the point, Joe.", "JOE: Okay, jeez.", "RORY: Now tonight is my mother's birthday party and the whole town is going to be there and they are expecting music, favors, and a really large pizza and they will not be disappointed.

Your parents must think I'm a lunatic.", "NICOLE: No, I don't think lunatic was one of the words they used.

How the hell can the police department have an answering machine? [hangs up the phone]", "LUKE: Look, let's just calm down.", "JESS: Who would steal that car? It hardly ran.", "LUKE: Well, you know these chop shops, they can make a buck out of anything.", "JESS: I am gonna kill whoever did this. I'm gonna find them and kill them.", "LUKE: Listen, just go on over to school, I'll take care of anything.", "JESS: No, I gotta talk to the cops.", "LUKE: I'll do that, go.

Listen Rory, I'm not sure if you're aware of how hard it has been for me these past three years to be indebted to my parents.

You only know the warm and fuzzy Richard and Emily, and I only want you to know the warm and fuzzy Richard and Emily because they're your grandparents and they love you, but I have a different history with them and it was not all warm and it was definitely not all fuzzy. So do not judge me for repaying a loan that I always intended to repay, that I told them from the beginning I would repay, that I had to repay. I will not let them make me feel guilty for doing that and I will not let you make me feel guilty for doing that either.", "RORY: I'm sorry.", "LORELAI: It's okay.", "[They walk down the street some more.
