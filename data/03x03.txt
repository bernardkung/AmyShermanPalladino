Kirk, if you will.", "[Kirk pushes a covered table in front of the podium]", "TAYLOR: Kirk, I told you to get something decorative to cover it.", "KIRK: Well, my mom wouldn't let me use one of her nice tablecloths so I just grabbed a sheet from my hamper.", "TAYLOR: Take it off.", "[Kirk removes the sheet to reveal a miniature model of the proposed soda shop]", "LUKE: What's that, a toy?", "MISS PATTY: Oh, it's awfully cute.", "TAYLOR: That is a professionally manufactured diorama of the proposed business.", "RORY: Wow, there's little people and everything.", "SOOKIE: They look so real.", "JACKSON: Hey, it's me holding a tiny zucchini!", "LORELAI: Look at the horse drawn carriage.", "TAYLOR: My thought was to park it out front with the name of the business painted on the side. It's very eighteen-hundreds.", "BABETTE: The horse is taller than the front door.", "LORELAI: Way taller.", "LUKE: What are you up to, Taylor? Are you breeding giant horses?", "TAYLOR: It's slightly out of proportion.", "BABETTE: Slightly? That little guy there could walk right under the horse without even ducking.", "TAYLOR: You're missing the big picture here, townsfolk. Now, this wonderful business belongs in Stars Hollow \u0096 whether Luke rents the space willingly or not.", "LUKE: How would I not rent it willingly?", "TAYLOR: I'm talking about eminent domain, my friend. Check the town's bylaws. If a three-fourths majority finds it necessary to use the space for a specific function, the landowner must concede.", "LUKE: That's for taking over houses to turn into hospitals during a national emergency like the Civil War. If you wanna turn this place into a Civil War hospital, be my guest!", "TAYLOR: Some would attest that the succor that my soda shop is going to offer is on the same level as the comfort that a hospital could provide.", "LUKE: You're gonna need a hospital, Taylor!", "LORELAI: Hit him!", "RORY: Which one?", "LORELAI: Either one, I'm easy.", "TAYLOR: Come on, Luke. This shop is based on the original soda shop that was in town eighty years ago. Don't you see? You are preventing the town \u0096", "LUKE: From moving backwards. Who here wants to do that?", "LORELAI: [in high voice] We like ice cream.", "LUKE: Oh, come on.", "RORY: A nice burger from Luke's and an ice cream soda, yum!", "LUKE: You want that thing?", "LORELAI: With a cherry.", "LUKE: With the striped awning and the giant horse?", "[Lorelai and Rory nod]", "LUKE: [to Taylor] Be ready to pay through the nose.", "TAYLOR: We'll talk terms. We have our soda shop everybody! Meeting dismissed.", "KIRK: Taylor, is it too soon to talk about management opportunities?", "LORELAI: [to Luke] Hey, you get to be Taylor's landlord, that's kind of cool.", "LUKE: Thanks for your lack of help.", "LORELAI: Grump.", "CUT TO OUTSIDE", "[As people file out of the town meeting, Lane walks up to Lorelai and Rory]", "LANE: So, how was lunch with Harvard guy?", "RORY: Great, he answered all my questions.", "LORELAI: He makes a killer chicken, he sticks a lemon up its butt.", "LANE: Nice.", "RORY: And he gave me excellent tips on how to write my essay. We're very impressed with him.", "LORELAI: He passes the test.", "[a boy walks up to Lane]", "DAVE: Excuse me, Lane?", "LANE: That's me.", "DAVE: Okay, great, I'm Dave Rygalski.", "LANE: Right, hi. You're a guitarist.", "DAVE: Yeah.", "LANE: But how'd you know I was me?", "DAVE: The Dead Kennedys shirt was a tip off.", "LANE: Good thinking. Hey, uh, isn't it a drag that Jello Biafra isn't singing for them anymore?", "DAVE: Yeah, now their front-man's that kid from the Courtship of Eddie's Father.", "LANE: Yeah, what's next \u0096 Urkel joining the Wu-Tang Clan?", "DAVE: Or maybe Malcolm in the Middle fronting for the Butthole Surfers.", "LANE: Some things are sacred.", "DAVE: I'm with ya on that.", "LANE: So, um, what's your band like?", "DAVE: We do a lot of cool covers \u0096 uh, the Clash, the Kinks, et cetera. Statistically, it's like thirty-eight of the forty-three bands you listed.", "LANE: Nice percentage.", "DAVE: I can play you a song we demo'd a couple weeks ago using a drum machine.", "LANE: Great. [he takes some audio equipment out of his bag] What's all this?", "DAVE: Well, this is a headphone amp and it just boosts the volume and makes the clarity off the hook, and then these are Grado 125s, which is just really, killer, killer portable sound. I'm sort of an audio geek, sorry.", "LANE: No, don't apologize, I love you. . .for that, for being that way. I love it. Um, I'm like that too.", "DAVE: You wanna go over to the bench maybe and have a listen?", "LANE: Yeah.", "DAVE: Okay.", "[they walk away]", "RORY: I think a love song's in their future.", "LORELAI: With lots of lyrics about snogging.", "RORY: About what?", "[Dean walks up behind them]", "DEAN: Hey.", "RORY: Hey. [they kiss] You missed everything.", "LORELAI: That's snogging.", "RORY: Got it.", "LORELAI: Bye. [walks away]", "DEAN: So, any fireworks?", "RORY: Well, there was a classic Luke/Taylor dispute, but it was resolved and will result in ice cream floats and twenty foot horses.", "DEAN: Good deal. And what about your lunch?", "RORY: Oh, it was great. I feel so much better about things now. The application's not freaking me out anymore.", "DEAN: You look unfreaked.", "RORY: Well, nothing can stop me now. It's full steam ahead.", "DEAN: That's great. Can I ask you something?", "RORY: Of course you can.", "DEAN: What happens when you leave?", "RORY: When I leave when?", "DEAN: When you leave for Harvard. . .do we break up?", "RORY: Whoa, that was blunt and out of nowhere.", "DEAN: Well, it seems like we should be blunt right now.", "RORY: No, we don't break up. Do you want that?", "DEAN: No, but how will we see each other?", "RORY: Easy, weekends \u0096 that's what they were invented for.", "DEAN: So you'll come home, do homework all weekend, then leave.", "RORY: No, I can do my homework during the week or on the train coming home to see you, who I will spend my weekends with not doing homework. Plus, we can talk during the week on the phone constantly. Trust me, it'll feel like I never left.", "DEAN: Oh yeah?", "RORY: Christiane Amanpour spends half of her life standing in foxholes in third world countries, and she has a husband and a kid. And she was on C-SPAN last week getting some award, so if she and her husband can make it work, we can.", "DEAN: So we'll have access to the CNN jet?", "RORY: No. Or hey, you can go to college in Boston.", "DEAN: I'm going to junior college.", "RORY: Boston has junior colleges.", "DEAN: But not dorm rooms.", "RORY: Well, you can rent an apartment.", "DEAN: With the money I get when I win the lottery? I mean, I think access to the CNN jet is more likely.", "RORY: Why are you being like this? So. . .", "DEAN: Realistic?", "RORY: Come on, be serious.", "DEAN: I am. I am.", "RORY: That's too serious.", "DEAN: Yeah, uh, you know, just forget it. Come on, we were gonna go to Luke's, right?", "RORY: Yeah.", "DEAN: Let's go to Luke's.", "[they walk past Lane and Dave on the bench]", "LANE: It's great, it really is.", "DAVE: Okay, cool. Well, listen, then I'll talk to the guys, uh, and we'll get together and play next week.", "LANE: Sure. Um, I've gotta get home.", "DAVE: All right. Well, uh, it was good meeting you, Lane.", "LANE: Same here.", "[Lane takes off her Dead Kennedys shirt; underneath is a shirt that says Trust God]", "DAVE: Trust God \u0096 is that a band?", "LANE: No. My life.", "[pan to Lorelai, Sookie, and Jackson]", "SOOKIE: Oh, come on, you do not like modern art.", "JACKSON: Oh, then I was mistaken, I guess I don't. I'm a mindless android, I have no opinions.", "SOOKIE: Well, what kind do you like?", "LORELAI: Yeah, do you like the kind that looks like someone hemorrhaged on a canvas?", "JACKSON: Yes, I love hemorrhaging.", "SOOKIE: Or the sculpture that looks like it was dropped and then glued back together?", "JACKSON: Actually, the real love of my life is being mercilessly teased by the two of you for simply stating an opinion.", "LORELAI: Oh, we're sorry.", "SOOKIE: Yeah, we're sorry. Kisses!", "JACKSON: Oh, in public, no less.", "LORELAI: Hey, where's Rory? We need all the girls a-kissing ya.", "JACKSON: Hey, that reminds me, what are you gonna do with Rory's room?", "LORELAI: Her room, when?", "JACKSON: When she's gone. Are you doing anything with it?", "LORELAI: Well, I haven't thought about it.", "JACKSON: Well, let me know. We can work something out.", "LORELAI: You want her room?", "SOOKIE: For what, your burgeoning modern art collection?", "JACKSON: I'm talking about my tools.", "SOOKIE: Oh, your tools, yeah.", "LORELAI: What tools?", "JACKSON: I have this collection of antique farming tools that my dad passed down to me.", "SOOKIE: Pre-Revolutionary War. They're kind of valuable.", "JACKSON: And I've got no place to put them. I've been looking for the right space.", "LORELAI: In Rory's room?", "SOOKIE: It's perfect!", "LORELAI: But she's got all her stuff in it.", "JACKSON: Not for long.", "LORELAI: Yeah, right, not for long.", "JACKSON: Just think about it.", "LORELAI: Yeah, I will. I will.", "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE", "[The phone is ringing]", "LORELAI: No, no, not another band phone call!", "RORY: We never gave Lane a cutoff time.", "LORELAI: Let the machine get it.

This is Darren Springsteen, how are ya? I just wanted to let you know that I just finished going over Rory's records here, and no shock, they're perfect. Rory, you are tailor-made for Harvard. They're lucky to have you. As far as I'm concerned, you should pack your bags. I'm gonna tell all this to the people in admissions and I'll give your headmaster a call as well, so take care and we'll talk again. Bye-bye. [hangs up]", "LORELAI: That's fantastic, honey.", "RORY: Yeah.", "LORELAI: You're in.", "RORY: Well, not officially.", "LORELAI: He said pack your bags.", "RORY: Yeah, cool.", "LORELAI: So what are you up to today? You have, uh, newspaper stuff to do, right?", "RORY: Yeah, a ton, and you were going to catch up with some stuff at the inn?", "LORELAI: Payroll. . . a lot of check signing to do.", "RORY: Are people waiting for their checks?", "LORELAI: Kind of.", "RORY: Right. You know, um, the newspaper stuff can wait \u0091til Monday.", "LORELAI: Really? \u0091Cause I can sign the checks tomorrow.", "RORY: You sure?", "LORELAI: Absolutely.", "RORY: So what do you wanna do?", "LORELAI: I don't know, what do you wanna do?", "RORY: I don't know, let's just hang.", "LORELAI: That sounds great.", "CUT TO TOWN SQUARE", "[Lorelai and Rory walk down the sidewalk past Luke's.

You were that sure that I would cave in?", "TAYLOR: Well, you did, didn't you? The right's too high.", "LUKE: And when did it become Taylor's? It said Stars Hollow on the stupid model, and I don't like the extra P and E at the end of shop.
