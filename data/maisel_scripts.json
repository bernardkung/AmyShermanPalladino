Here you go.", "So I went to Chinatown and I bought this herbal paste that you're supposed to put on during certain times when certain things are happening or supposed to be happening or are probably happening to most people anyway, but theoretically, when things could be happening, just to someone else but never to me, you put it on.", "Ugh, it's so strong.", "It's like a mixture of ammonia and Esther's diaper.", "So you put the paste on, which I did, and then a month later, you're supposed to get pregnant.", "They didn't tell me about the smell.", "I don't think... they might have. They're Chinese.", "But it has a smell, and it tends to harden as it dries, which is why I'm walking so funny.", "You know, let's just go back to ignoring it, shall we?", "That's what I've been doing for a month.", "Oh, hey, Noah, you can drop me off at the Concord.", "Why?
