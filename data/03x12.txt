If the other guys see him talking down to me like that, they will totally be thrown off track.", "RORY: Okay, but doesn't it bother you to hear him talk to you like that?", "LANE: No way.

How about you?", "LORELAI: Ah, there's a reason they call it the great outdoors, right?", "ALEX: I was actually thinking of doing a little fishing this Saturday.", "LORELAI: Oh, that sounds like fun.", "ALEX: This great place, beautiful, perfect fishing.

Anyway, I sat her down and I told her that I really wanted to go to the prom. And I know she doesn't approve of such things, but if she lets me go, we will do it her way.", "RORY: But her way would be not to let you go.", "LANE: Yes, she said that also.

By the time she says yes, she'll love him even more and then when I say I wanna go to the prom with him, it'll be like she picked him out herself.", "RORY: You are brilliant.

Well, then she's gonna need some sparkles.", "LANE: Okay, I think that's it.", "RORY: Let's go. Can you imagine marrying someone you didn't know?", "LANE: Are you kidding?

I don't lie to guys to make them like me. I just got stuck when he said fishing and camping, and I was trying to be nice and not say, \"Fishing? Great \u0096 cold, wet, and smelly.

Maybe I could go fishing. Maybe. Once.", "SOOKIE: Tell me about Alex.", "LORELAI: Well, he owns an iron company. They do gates and statues, big fancy stuff.

Business which I must now, unfortunately, share with all of you.

We've heard enough.", "PARIS: I move to put to a vote the impeachment of Rory Gilmore.", "RORY: Hey!", "ADVISOR: Miss Gellar, I'm sorry, but we do not impeach here at Chilton.", "PARIS: Why not?", "ADVISOR: Because this is a student government.", "PARIS: Well, then, I'd like to put to a vote a resolution to instate the ability to impeach.

This behavior will stop this instant. It is disgraceful, especially from the political leaders of this campus. Now, I'd like to know what is actually driving this recent rash of infighting.

Sexist, white-haired \u0096", "HEADMASTER: Paris, are you muttering?", "PARIS: No, sorry.", "HEADMASTER: All right, if it isn't a boy, perhaps it's a popularity thing. Someone didn't get invited to someone else's party? Or perhaps this is a power struggle of some sort. No? Well, then I'll stop guessing and start lecturing. Ms. Gilmore, you will not be quitting the student council, is that clear?", "RORY: Yes, sir.", "HEADMASTER: The student body has elected you and therefore you will fulfill your commitment. And in the future, I would advise you to think long and hard about accepting any responsibility if you intend to run away from it at the first sign of conflict. And Ms. Gellar, you worked very hard to get to the position you hold in this school, and yet now you are willing to throw all that away on petty vendettas and childish antics. Indeed, it makes me wonder. . .if you two can't resolve your issues in this sheltered \u0096 some would say pampered \u0096 environment, how on Earth will you ever survive in college? As student council officers, you represent Chilton to those inside and outside these hallowed halls. Right now, the world sees us as a group of sniveling, spiteful, vindictive individuals \u0096 not really what I'd hoped for, nor is that how I portrayed the two of you in my personal letter of recommendation to Harvard.
