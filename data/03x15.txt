You'd know that if you'd \u0096 what, ladies and gentlemen? That's right \u0096 bothered to call.", "JESS: Why are you hassling me?", "LORELAI: Well, mostly because I'm here to hassle you.

You like music, right? The Beach Boys said it best. None of the guys go steady \u0091cause it wouldn't be right to leave their best girls home on a Saturday night. Rory is one of the best girls.

Later doesn't cut it anymore, got it? And, yeah, you know, maybe I am spoiled. But guess what? I like being spoiled. I plan to go on being spoiled.

I had no right to humiliate you like that, in front of your friends, in front of Richard. This relationship was something you had chosen to keep private and I should have respected that.

Mom, please believe me, I know how important your pride is to you, and I never had any intention of robbing you of it. I feel terrible that I caused you any pain. I just wish that once in awhile, you might feel a little bit terrible that you cause me pain. I have pride, too, you know.

Thanksgiving would probably work also. Listen, Dad, I know you're a little upset with Mom right now, and I'm probably out of line in saying this, but you might wanna think about cutting her some slack. She's really missed you lately. I mean, you work so much and then you're helping Gran in your free time, which is totally understandable, but still, it's hard.

I feel so powerful.", "RORY: Just remember, there's cute jealous and there's Othello.", "LANE: Good point.", "RORY: So, who else thinks I'm a snob?", "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE", "[Lorelai walks into the front entryway as there's a knock at the door. She opens it.]", "LORELAI: Jess.", "JESS: Hey, is Rory here?", "LORELAI: Are you serious?", "JESS: Yeah, I'm serious.", "LORELAI: No, I'm serious. Are you serious?", "JESS: Why do you keep asking me if I'm serious?", "LORELAI: Because I'm just trying to imagine the scenario here. You looked at the clock that said it was 7:30 on a Saturday night and you thought to yourself, \"Hey, Rory must be home.\"", "JESS: Yes.", "LORELAI: I'm sorry, are you serious?", "JESS: Okay, I'm guessing that's your way of telling me she's not home.", "LORELAI: No, Jess, she's not home.", "JESS: Do you know where she is?", "LORELAI: She's at the hockey game.", "JESS: Hey, look, you don't wanna tell me where she is, fine.", "LORELAI: Jess, she really is at the hockey game. You'd know that if you'd \u0096 what, ladies and gentlemen? That's right \u0096 bothered to call.", "JESS: Why are you hassling me?", "LORELAI: Well, mostly because I'm here to hassle you. Now, if you'd bothered calling, maybe Rory would be here to hassle you.", "JESS: Hey, Rory knows I'm not the kind of guy who lives by a schedule.", "LORELAI: Yes, and look what the guy who doesn't live by a schedule ends up doing on a Saturday night \u0096 talking to his girlfriend's mother.", "JESS: Whatever.", "LORELAI: Hey, Jess. You like music, right? The Beach Boys said it best. None of the guys go steady \u0091cause it wouldn't be right to leave their best girls home on a Saturday night. Rory is one of the best girls. She's the best girl, if you want my opinion, and you don't seem to have the first idea as to how she should be treated.", "JESS: Well, luckily I've got you to tell me.", "LORELAI: Not anymore. You and I have discussed your relationship with Rory long enough.", "JESS: Fine.", "LORELAI: I'll tell her you stopped by.", "JESS: Don't bother. [leaves]", "LORELAI: Brian Hutchins is looking pretty good right about now.", "CUT TO HOCKEY GAME", "[Rory and Lane are carrying their food back to their seats]", "RORY: If I had known sports were so much about eating, I would've come to a lot more of these.", "LANE: I know. There's something deeply satisfying about watching other people exercise while eating junk food.", "KIRK: Ten minutes \u0091til the next period, ladies and gentlemen. That's what we call them in hockey \u0096 periods, not halves. Let's try to keep that straight. Also, the puck is never referred to as a ball, not according to the book. Again, my bad.", "[Rory and Lane see Dean and Lindsay kissing]", "LANE: I guess it wasn't the Chilton thing after all.", "CUT TO LATER IN THE HOCKEY GAME", "KIRK: Number twelve has it now. He's skating, he's skating. My bet is he's going to try to whack it into that net thingy, but that's conjecture at this point. Now it's going the other way and they're hitting it between them. Number seven has it. Now number three. Now seven. Three again. Seven. Ten's got it now.", "[Dean skates over to Kirk]", "DEAN: Kirk, just to let you know, some of the guys \u0096 not me, you know \u0096 but some of the guys say they're gonna rip your head off if you don't shut up, okay?", "KIRK: We'll be pausing for a short break.", "CROWD: [cheers] We've got spirit, yes we do! We've got spirit, how about you?", "LANE: You sure you're okay?", "RORY: Will you stop asking me that every five seconds? I'm fine. I mean, it had to happen sometime. I didn't expect him to just sit around pining for me. Okay, a little, but she's really nice, right?", "LANE: This is all my fault.", "RORY: Lane.", "LANE: I let you down. I'm supposed to be your eyes and ears in that school, and here's the biggest piece of news all year and I had no idea.", "RORY: It's okay.", "LANE: No, it's not. This is an intelligence gaffe of monumental proportions. What was I doing that I didn't notice this?", "RORY: Studying, taking classes.", "LANE: Well, no more.", "RORY: Lane, it's not a big deal, really. And now I know, so, case closed.", "LANE: You're sure?", "RORY: Positive. Let's just enjoy the game.", "PLAYER: No way!", "KIRK: Excuse me, will you tell me what happened? Excuse me, number fourteen?

Well, you pose a very deep and philosophical question there, but I think I'll just \u0096", "[Emily walks over]", "EMILY: Lorelai. I thought I heard your voice.", "LORELAI: Yes, I brought the slide machine and the platters and the punch bowl.", "EMILY: Wonderful.

VAN WYCK: It's obscene.", "TRIX: It's Picasso.", "MRS. VAN WYCK: Then Picasso is obscene.", "TRIX: Oh, Isabelle.", "MRS. VAN WYCK: It has six breasts.", "TRIX: You cannot be sure if those are breasts. They could be canons. He was quite obsessed with the Spanish Civil War for awhile.", "EMILY: Ladies, look who's here.", "TRIX: Lorelai, wonderful. We all need a break for a moment. Come meet my friends. Emily, we were waiting for iced tea or am I imagining things?", "EMILY: It's on its way, Mom.", "TRIX: So is death. Lorelai, this is Mrs. Van Wyck, Mrs. Deerborne, Mrs. Rutherman. This is my granddaughter, Lorelai.", "LORELAI: Nice to meet you all.", "TRIX: Well, come, sit.", "LORELAI: Oh, I don't want to interrupt anything.", "TRIX: You're interrupting nothing but thirst, my dear. Now, talk to some old women, tell us what it's like to be young.", "LORELAI: Not nearly as much fun since the mandatory sunscreen rule, I'll tell ya.", "[the maid brings in a platter]", "EMILY: Here we go, iced tea and sandwiches.", "TRIX: [picks up a glass] Too warm. Do you know that Lorelai's daughter is graduating from Chilton in June?", "[Emily walks over to the drink cart to put ice in the glass]", "EMILY: [sings] Love in the afternoon. . .", "TRIX: She is an excellent student and may. . .", "EMILY: La, la, la, la, la. . .", "TRIX: Emily, what are you doing?", "EMILY: I'm sorry?", "TRIX: Why are you singing like that?", "EMILY: Was I signing? I didn't realize. Here's your tea, Mom. I certainly hope it's cold enough.", "LORELAI: Um, I brought the slide projector over. Would you like me to set it up?", "TRIX: That would be fine. We can start watching now since I do not anticipate dinner being served anywhere near the time I requested.", "EMILY: [sings] Our hearts are filled with joy. . .", "TRIX: Emily you're doing it again.", "EMILY: I was?", "TRIX: Yes, you were.", "EMILY: Huh. You know, it's because I caught some of \"Love in the Afternoon\" the other day, the movie. Have you seen it, Mom?", "TRIX: I don't believe I have.", "EMILY: Oh, well, it's wonderful. And a wonderful concept, too, don't you think? Anyway, I must have the music stuck in my head. That must be why I'm singing it. I mean, what else could it be, hm?", "LORELAI: Hey, Mom, how \u0091bout we go get some of that cheese you bought for the ladies, huh? I'll help you. Come on. We'll be right back.", "[Lorelai and Emily walk into the kitchen]", "LORELAI: Okay, what is going on?", "EMILY: I saw her kissing a man.", "LORELAI: What?", "EMILY: When I came home today, I walked in and I saw her standing in the living room kissing a man.", "LORELAI: Gran?", "EMILY: Yes.", "LORELAI: My Gran?", "EMILY: Yes.", "LORELAI: My Gran was kissing a man?", "EMILY: In a purple velour jogging suit.", "LORELAI: Gran was in a purple velour jogging suit?", "EMILY: No, the man was wearing a purple jogging suit.", "LORELAI: And you're sure they were kissing?", "EMILY: One hundred percent sure.", "LORELAI: My God. Was he hot?", "EMILY: Excuse me?", "LORELAI: Well, I don't know what you're supposed to ask when you hear your grandmother's been making out with a guy.", "EMILY: I don't know if he was hot. Your grandmother sucking face was blocking my view.", "LORELAI: What'd she do? Did she see you?", "EMILY: No. After my heart started back up again, I went outside and hid in the bushes until he left.", "LORELAI: Okay, now I have two really good visuals fighting for top billing here.", "EMILY: Do you realize how wonderful this is?", "LORELAI: Yeah, I guess it's wonderful, Gran has a guy.", "EMILY: No, what's wonderful is after all these years of her abuse, her condescension, her insults and her degrading comments, after all these years of pure unadulterated hell, I finally have something to hold over her.", "LORELAI: Oh, Mom.", "EMILY: Finally, I have the upper hand. Finally, I have something to nail her with. Finally, that woman is going down.", "LORELAI: You cannot use this against Gran.", "EMILY: Yes, I can, I've earned it.", "LORELAI: Mom, I know Gran gives you a hard time, but she did not tell anyone about this guy for a reason.", "EMILY: Yes, because she's embarrassed. She should be.

Well, that makes me feel so much better.", "[they walk back to the living room]", "MRS. VAN WYCK: And is this normal, Richard, to be getting home from work so late?", "RICHARD: Oh, that's one of the pitfalls of starting your own business, I'm afraid.", "TRIX: You should say, of starting a successful business, Richard.", "RICHARD: Successful so far, Trix. Let's not jinx it.", "TRIX: Though, perhaps if Emily could have the meal served on time, Richard would have more inducement to get home at a reasonable hour.", "EMILY: I saw her kissing a man in a track suit!", "RICHARD: What?", "TRIX: Emily!", "CUT TO HOCKEY GAME", "[The game is over. People are filing out of the stands]", "KIRK: Well, ladies and gentlemen, much like the Israelites of Yore, the Stars Hollow Minutemen languished in the desert for forty years. But tonight, there was no Promised Land, no New Canaan, only a humiliating five to one defeat at the merciless hands of the West Hartford Wildcats. So it's back to the desert for the Minutemen, perhaps for another forty years. Of course, by then, I'll be seventy years old. A lot of the rest of you will probably be dead. Taylor, you'll be dead.

Have fun.", "YOUNG CHUI: Bye.", "RORY: Bye.", "DEAN: Hey.", "RORY: Dean. Hey, how are you? Oh, God, that's a stupid question to ask someone who just lost the regional semi-finals, isn't it? And now it sounds like I'm rubbing your face in it.", "DEAN: Don't worry about it. They were better than us, they deserved to win.", "RORY: And hey, at least you got a point. That's good, right? I mean, better than not getting any. Geez, I really suck at this post-sports talk.", "DEAN: Well, you haven't had much practice.", "RORY: True. But who knows, I might be a sports convert. I mean, the eating of massive amounts of junk food, and listening to Kirk make a fool of himself in front of a bunch of people \u0096 all things I enjoy.", "DEAN: In fact, you could almost get rid of the sports part of it.", "RORY: That's what I was going to say. So, I ran into Lindsay.", "DEAN: Yeah, I hadn't quite figured out how to tell you that.", "RORY: Well, I think it's great.", "DEAN: You do?", "RORY: Absolutely. I mean, she's cute and smart and really nice.", "DEAN: I know.", "RORY: Like once, in fourth grade, we went on a field trip to Mark Twain's house, and I really wanted this refrigerator magnet in the shape of Mark Twain's head, but I didn't have any money, so she bought it for me, and she wouldn't even let me pay her back. Pretty classy for a fourth grader.", "DEAN: That sounds like Lindsay.", "RORY: Exactly. So, good job, mister.", "DEAN: Thanks. So, how are things with Jess?", "RORY: Oh, good, good.", "DEAN: He's not with you?", "RORY: No. This really isn't his kind of thing.", "DEAN: Yeah. Well, uh, I'd better go. I gotta change and then Lindsay and I are going out.", "RORY: Right. Sure. Have fun.", "[Dean leaves.

I just wanted to let you know that this is the last weekend I spend sitting around like an idiot hoping you'll call, okay? I'm not going to be that girl. From now on, I want a plan. I mean, a real plan with a time and a place, and I'm tired of hearing \u0091Let's hook up later.' What does that mean anyway? What's later? How do I set my watch to later? Later doesn't cut it anymore, got it? And, yeah, you know, maybe I am spoiled. But guess what? I like being spoiled. I plan to go on being spoiled. And if that doesn't sound like something that you can or want to do, then fine. I'm sure you'll find another girl who doesn't mind sitting around cleaning her keyboard on a Friday night hoping you'll call, but it's not going to be me. Oh, yeah, this is a message for Jess.", "[Rory walks outside and sees Jess leaning against his car]", "JESS: Hey. Figured I'd find you here. I mean, you say the word hockey, you say the word Rory, right?", "RORY: What are you doing here?", "JESS: Came to give you these.", "RORY: Earplugs. What are these for?", "JESS: I got tickets to the Distillers.", "RORY: You did? For when?", "JESS: For tonight.", "RORY: Tonight? But \u0096", "JESS: I would've been here sooner, but I had to wait in line. So we should probably get going. I mean, we don't wanna miss anything, right?", "RORY: Hey, Jess?", "JESS: Yeah?", "RORY: When you get home, could you erase your answering machine without listening to any of the messages? That'd be great, thanks.", "CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE", "[Trix is lying in bed. There's a knock at the door]", "GRAN: Come in.", "[Emily walks in]", "EMILY: I brought you some aspirin. It's the buffered kind that you like. Is there anything else that you need?", "GRAN: No, thank you.", "EMILY: Mom, I want to apologize for what I said downstairs. I had no right to humiliate you like that, in front of your friends, in front of Richard. This relationship was something you had chosen to keep private and I should have respected that. I am truly sorry. He seemed like a very nice man. Why didn't you tell anyone about him?", "GRAN: I married once, I married Richard's father. That was my husband. I have no desire to marry again and dishonor his memory.", "EMILY: I understand.", "GRAN: I believe a woman marries for life. If, after your husband is gone, you desperately desire some sort of permanent attachment, add an addition onto the house \u0096 a library or a solarium. I have a library and a solarium.", "EMILY: Yes, you do.", "GRAN: However, in spite of all this, I found myself getting lonely. And I don't care for being lonely, it's quite annoying. So many years ago, I met a man, and he became my companion. Tonight, both he and I were both publicly humiliated and our relationship altered forever. Can you imagine how that feels?", "EMILY: Actually, I've had a little experience with being humiliated in front of the people I love, yes. Mom, please believe me, I know how important your pride is to you, and I never had any intention of robbing you of it. I feel terrible that I caused you any pain. I just wish that once in awhile, you might feel a little bit terrible that you cause me pain. I have pride, too, you know. And my husband travels and is very busy and I miss him and I'm lonely sometimes, just like you.", "GRAN: Well.", "CUT TO DOWNSTAIRS", "[Lorelai and Richard are in the living room]", "LORELAI: So that was quite a gathering.", "RICHARD: Yes, it was.", "LORELAI: It would make a great Christmas story. I mean, I know it didn't happen at Christmas, but it's the kind of thing that would happen at Christmas, so it's not like if you told someone it did happen at Christmas, they'd go, \u0091Really? \u0091Cause it doesn't sound like a Christmas story.' Thanksgiving would probably work also. Listen, Dad, I know you're a little upset with Mom right now, and I'm probably out of line in saying this, but you might wanna think about cutting her some slack. She's really missed you lately. I mean, you work so much and then you're helping Gran in your free time, which is totally understandable, but still, it's hard. As much as Gran likes you, she tends to be a littler rough on Mom, and I think Mom just kind of snapped. She'd never do anything like that intentionally. You do know that, Dad, right?", "[Richard starts laughing]", "LORELAI: Dad? Okay, apparently it's two-for-one flip out night at the Gilmore house.", "RICHARD: Do you really think he was wearing a track suit?", "LORELAI: I don't. . .", "RICHARD: Well, I wonder if he was wearing Nike's also.", "LORELAI: Just Do It takes on a whole new meaning, doesn't it?", "RICHARD: I guess I've got a new daddy.", "LORELAI: Maybe he'll take you to ball games.", "RICHARD: Oh, we could get matching jogging suits. Oh, if only I could've seen Emily hiding in the bushes. It's like a play by Moliere.", "[Emily walks down the steps]", "EMILY: What are you two cackling about?", "RICHARD: Oh, nothing.", "LORELAI: Yeah, nothing.", "EMILY: Well, don't stop on my account. I'm just passing through.", "RICHARD: Where are you going?", "EMILY: We're going to have tea.", "LORELAI: They're going to have tea?", "RICHARD: That's a first.", "LORELAI: Maybe they're going to be pals now.", "RICHARD: I don't know how I feel about my mother and my wife being in cahoots.", "LORELAI: I don't know how I feel about you saying the word cahoots.", "RICHARD: Well, this alliance could make things very uncomfortable for me.", "[Emily walks past them with a tray of tea]", "EMILY: Sending a maid down to tell me how to make tea, as if I don't know after all these years. Guess she'll have a coronary if the water hits the cup one second before the bag.", "LORELAI: I think you're safe.", "RICHARD: I think so, too.", "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE", "[Lorelai is eating at the kitchen table when Rory comes home]", "LORELAI: Hey, how was the game?", "RORY: Fun, we got clobbered.", "LORELAI: Oh. If you'd won, you could've rioted through town trashing storefronts and torching police cars like they do in L.A.", "RORY: Maybe next year.", "LORELAI: What'd you do after?", "RORY: Oh, you know, just hung out.", "LORELAI: With Lane and her fake boyfriend?", "RORY: Uh huh. I thought you were eating at Grandma's.", "LORELAI: Oh, yes, and there's a story behind that.", "RORY: Can it wait \u0091til tomorrow? I'm really exhausted.", "LORELAI: It's a good story.", "RORY: I'm sure. I just won't be able to fully appreciate it in my weakened state. And this gives you extra time to practice your voices.", "LORELAI: Fine, fine. Let me just say two words \u0096 jogging suit.", "RORY: Jogging suit.", "LORELAI: See, you're hooked.", "RORY: Yeah, well, now I'm definitely waking up tomorrow.", "LORELAI: Night honey.", "RORY: Night Mom.", "[Rory walks into her bedroom and lies down on her bed]", "THE END"]}
