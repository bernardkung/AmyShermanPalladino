You know what you did.", "JESS: I gotta go.", "LANE: Yes, drive on away, we'll just keep walking. That's all Rory's been able to do these past few months \u0096 lots of walking.

Stay.", "LORELAI: What?", "SHERRY: Come to the party, please?", "LORELAI: Oh, I don't know.", "SHERRY: I know that you weren't invited, but it's just \u0091cause my friends didn't think that you'd be comfortable. I told them not to worry.", "LORELAI: Thanks, but I'm not really dressed for a party.", "SHERRY: Oh, please. We're not formal here, you look fine.", "LORELAI: Well. . .um. . .", "RORY: Um, Mom kind of has plans.", "LORELAI: Yeah, I got a couple credit cards burning a hole in my wallet.", "SHERRY: Oh, go shopping some other time and come play with us. Please? There's just a bunch of people in there that Rory doesn't know, and having you here would make her so much more comfortable.", "RORY: Oh, I don't mind not knowing anyone at the party, really.", "SHERRY: That's nice, honey, but very unconvincing. Lorelai, I meant to extend the invitation to both of you. I just wasn't sure if you'd. . .
