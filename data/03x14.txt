And you going up there just now saved me a trip, so thanks.", "LORELAI: Glad to be of service.", "LUKE: I got a good system, it works.", "LORELAI: Every ten minutes?", "LUKE: Like clockwork, never a minute more.", "LORELAI: Even if you're serving a customer, it's every ten minutes?", "LUKE: If I'm in mid-pour, I stop and go up.", "LORELAI: Ten minutes. Yeah, that's pretty much the time it took to create Rory. And that included getting dressed and freshening my lipstick.", "LUKE: What?", "LORELAI: Thanks for the book.", "LUKE: Caesar, cover for me.", "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE", "[Rory walks toward the staircase]", "LORELAI: [from upstairs] Rory?", "RORY: I'm coming.", "LORELAI: Toute de suite, and I don't mean the candy.", "[Rory walks into Lorelai's bedroom]", "RORY: Okay, what's the packing crisis?", "LORELAI: That's the thing. I have no packing crisis. For the first time in my life, there is no packing crisis. See? This has never happened to me before. I'm all packed, ready to go, and fully confident that I have everything I'll need or desire.", "RORY: So you're creating a crisis out of nostalgia?", "LORELAI: No, see, Alex and I talked about everything we plan to do and how he expected to dress and how I expected to dress, and we coordinated to the point where I knew each piece of clothing I had to bring, down to the Spice Girls necklace I plan to wear Saturday morning for breakfast because we agreed to keep it a little whimsical.", "RORY: So, not your Jonas Salk necklace?", "LORELAI: I'm trying to become as good a planner as you.", "RORY: So, what's the problem?", "LORELAI: I have no idea what to wear on the drive. I wanna look good, obviously, but not too good that it steps on my night outfit, and I also wanna be comfortable.", "RORY: What's he wearing, a jogging suit?", "LORELAI: Yeah, and then after, he and Paulie are hitting the Bada Bing.", "RORY: Your point being, it's probably not a running suit.", "LORELAI: Right.", "RORY: And tonight's a dress?", "LORELAI: And, uh, my cashmere coat and a hat.", "RORY: Your stretchy jeans and your Bunnyranch T-shirt.", "LORELAI: Comfort and raunch, I love it. Good. So, um, how are you guys working the logistics tonight?", "RORY: I am going to study at school, then I'm going straight to Grandma's from there. Jess is driving straight from work, and then he's driving me home.", "LORELAI: Home? Home here?", "RORY: Yeah, he's gonna drop me off here.", "LORELAI: Well, I guess that makes sense.", "RORY: I thought so.", "LORELAI: Although, hm, I don't know.", "RORY: What?", "LORELAI: Are you sure that's the best way to do it?", "RORY: Yeah, why?", "LORELAI: Well, it just means you're coming home to an empty house.", "RORY: Well, that's your doing, not mine.", "LORELAI: Yeah, but it might be kind of lonely here. Did you think about staying at Mom's?", "RORY: Overnight?", "LORELAI: Yeah. They've got those fancy beds that don't sag, and you're guaranteed a great Norma Desmond style breakfast the next morning. You don't have school, it works out perfectly.", "RORY: I'd rather just come home.", "LORELAI: Okay, sure. But, you know, staying at your grandmother's would also mean that Jess wouldn't have to go out of his way at the end of the night to drop you off. It would be much more convenient for him.", "RORY: Our house is two-tenths of a mile out of his way.", "LORELAI: Are you sure he's gonna have enough gas?", "RORY: I'll make sure.", "LORELAI: But if you can't get a hold of him, it might be safer to plan on staying at Mom's. I mean, if you run out of gas, you're stuck. And at the mercy of the Orcs.", "RORY: Mom, why are you so freaked?", "LORELAI: This is not freaked.", "RORY: Is it because you won't be here and he will?", "LORELAI: Uh, it might've crossed my mind.", "RORY: And what are you worried about happening?", "LORELAI: Well, what you guys were on the on-ramp for up at Luke's the other day. Your basic boy/girl stuff. Especially with this new boy, you girl stuff.", "RORY: Well, the boy is different, but I'm still me. That hasn't changed.", "LORELAI: Yeah, I know.", "RORY: And I have so much on my mind, so many things going on in my life, that I don't ever have time to think about that.", "LORELAI: No thinking at all?", "RORY: None, I swear.", "LORELAI: Mmhmm, sure, sure.", "RORY: And we talk about everything together, you and me, remember?

Does it hurt?", "JESS: I'm fine.", "RORY: Is it why you were late?", "JESS: No, 84 was jammed.", "EMILY: We knew that, too. There was something with a big rig. Oh, those things, they scare the life out of me. And apparently, all the men who drive them are hopped up on bennies and goofballs. Come, come, have a seat at the table. I'll go check on dinner.

I don't see how anybody can resist eating meat.", "JESS: It's why we have teeth.", "EMILY: That's how I feel. Dinner parties used to be simple. Now every time we give one, I have to run my menu down with every person on the list. It's tiring.

Why? I'm trying to make some kind of quasi-positive impression on your grandmother per your request and you're forcing me to do otherwise. And what the hell are raisins doing in a salad?
