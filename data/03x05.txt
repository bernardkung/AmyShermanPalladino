Uh, so, Mom, it was a very nice bunch of people you had at that auction.", "EMILY: Yes, very nice.", "LORELAI: I was surprised at how many young people were there. I mean, you know, younger people.

I don't have his number.", "LORELAI: Okay, then, never mind.", "EMILY: I can get his number. Would you like me to get his number?", "LORELAI: Um, it's up to you.", "EMILY: It can't be up to me. I didn't ask for his number, you asked for his number, therefore it has to be up to you as to whether or not I get his number.", "LORELAI: Okay, Mom.", "EMILY: Would you like me to get his number?", "LORELAI: Yes, if you don't mind.", "EMILY: I don't mind at all.", "LORELAI: Thank you.", "EMILY: You're welcome.", "LORELAI: I wasn't kidding about that military school.", "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE", "[Lorelai rushes down the steps]", "LORELAI: Okay, the clock is right!

So. . .[pager goes off] My pager.", "JESS: Yeah, I figured.", "[Rory checks the pager, then puts it away]", "JESS: Who is it?", "RORY: It's, uh, Dean. I paged him earlier to come over and help me and he just got the message, so he's. . .", "JESS: Coming over to help.", "RORY: Yeah.", "JESS: Okay.", "[Jess turns the sprinkler back on and walks away]", "CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE", "[The doorbell rings, Emily answers the door]", "LORELAI: Hi Mom.", "EMILY: Hello Lorelai.", "RORY: Hi Grandma.", "EMILY: Hello Rory. That's a pretty sweater.", "RORY: Thank you.", "[they start walking to the living room]", "EMILY: I do love you in blue, you should wear blue more often. Buy her more blue, Lorelai.", "LORELAI: Oh, I'll get right on it. So, I brought you something Mom.", "EMILY: Oh really? Soda, Rory?", "RORY: Yes, please.", "LORELAI: Um, these are some pictures from Sookie's wedding. There's a great one of you and Dad dancing. I put them in an album for you.", "EMILY: Well, that's very nice, thank you.", "LORELAI: You wanna see?", "EMILY: I'm making drinks right now, Lorelai.", "LORELAI: Right, later it is.", "EMILY: [hands Rory a glass] Here you go. [hands Lorelai a glass] Here.", "LORELAI: Oh, guess I'm having wine.", "EMILY: You didn't want wine?", "LORELAI: Wine's fine.", "EMILY: Give it back, I'll get you something else.", "LORELAI: No, I'm good with wine, Mom.", "EMILY: I can make you a martini, would you like a martini?", "LORELAI: No, I just \u0096 you usually ask me what I want, and tonight you didn't ask me what I wanted so I didn't have a chance to tell you how much I would love some wine.", "EMILY: I bought some cheese to have before dinner.", "RORY: Great, we love cheese.", "LORELAI: It goes great with wine.", "EMILY: I will be right back.

She's mad at me.", "RORY: Yup.", "LORELAI: Think she's gonna be mad at me all night?", "RORY: Yup.", "LORELAI: I guess I should go in there and talk to her.", "RORY: Yup.", "LORELAI: You wouldn't wanna go in there and talk to her for me?", "RORY: Nope.", "LORELAI: Good thing you don't get paid by the word.", "RORY: The sooner you get in there, the sooner you get cheese.", "LORELAI: Fine.", "CUT TO KITCHEN", "[Emily is preparing a plate of cheese as Lorelai walks in]", "LORELAI: Need some help?", "EMILY: No, I'm fine, thank you.", "LORELAI: Mom, I just wanted to say I'm sorry.", "EMILY: Sorry for what?", "LORELAI: Sorry about the whole Peyton thing. When I asked you for his number, I didn't think. . .", "EMILY: Think about what?", "LORELAI: Think about what would happen if things didn't work out with us. I mean, I know his mom is your friend, and I shouldn't have even gotten mixed up in this whole thing if I wasn't prepared to remember that what I do will affect you, and to me it's just a Bowie concert, but to you, it's not. I was a little thoughtless and I'm sorry, but you have to understand that I was not lying when I said we had a bad time. We had a really, really, really, really, really bad time. I swear, it was one of the worst times I've ever had, it was awful. Do you remember skiing with the Danners and their Dobermans?", "EMILY: Oh, God, yes.", "LORELAI: This was worse. And, by the way, not just for me \u0096 it was pretty bad for him, too. It wasn't like he was in love and I was miserable. We were both in pain \u0096 deep pain, Marathon Man kind of pain. But despite all of this horrible pain that we were both in, and would be in again if we had to spend one more second together, if you really want me to, I will go to the Bowie concert with him.", "EMILY: Well, your saying that means a lot.", "LORELAI: Hm.", "EMILY: Thank you, Lorelai. Borrow Rory's sweater when you go. [leaves room]", "LORELAI: [sings] Ground control to Major Tom. . .", "THE END"]}
