# AmyShermanPalladino

Y'know who's made some great shows? Amy Freakin' Sherman Palladino! Gilmore Girls!? Marvelous Mrs. Maisel?! That other one that nobody else watched, and no I'm not talking about Gimore Girls: A Year in the Life, but obviously the deserving of a timely resurgence of popularity even if just for the untapped meme potential hidden gem of a show that is Bunheads!

Anyways, this isn't anything but the scraping and data cleaning for the rest of the project! Compartmentalizationizing!
